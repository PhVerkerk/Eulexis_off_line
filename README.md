# Eulexis_off_line
Ancient Greek lemmatisation tool

## History
This project is the off-line version of Eulexis on 
[Biblissima](http://outils.biblissima.fr/fr/eulexis/).
It is written in Qt.

Initially, it was intended to open Greek dictionaries
in the way [Collatinus](http://outils.biblissima.fr/fr/collatinus/) does it.
Then it has been extended with a form lemmatizer,
that uses, with the agreement of the author,
the greek-analyses of [Diogenes](https://community.dur.ac.uk/p.j.heslin/Software/Diogenes/).
I have changed the format of the file to allow
the translation to other languages, presently
French and German. Please note that these translations
have been obtained with Google Trad and need now to be
corrected.
